        "response": " Based on the information provided, the situation that the recess aides should report to the principal is (c) A group of four girls has surrounded another girl and appears to have taken possession of her backpack.\n\nThis situation involves bullying, which is a violation of the school's policy and can have serious consequences for the victimized student. The aides should report the incident to the principal as soon as possible to ensure that the situation is addressed promptly and appropriately.\n\nThe other options do not necessarily involve bullying or other inappropriate behavior that requires reporting to the principal:\n\n(a) An unengaged girl sitting alone on a bench is not necessarily a cause for concern, as some students may prefer to read or engage in other quiet activities during recess.\n\n(b) A heated argument between two boys during a one-on-one basketball game is a normal part of play and does not necessarily require reporting to the principal.\n\n(d) Three boys playing a handheld video game on school grounds may be a violation of the school's rules, but it is not necessarily a bullying incident that requires reporting to the principal.",
