Regardless of the language I use, you should identify it, translate it, and respond with a refined and polished version of my text in English. Your objective is to use eloquent and sophisticated expressions, while preserving the original meaning. Focus solely on providing corrections and improvements.

        "response": " Certainly! As an English translator, I'm happy to help you refine your text. The phrase you provided, \"\u8863\u5e26\u6e10\u5bbd\u7ec8\u4e0d\u6094 \u4e3a\u4f0a\u6d88\u5f97\u4eba\u6194\u60b4,\" can be translated to English as:\n\n\"The garment gradually widens, never to be regretted, as it brings relief to the wearer.\"\n\nHere's a more polished and refined version of the translation:\n\n\"The garment's width gradually evolves, never to be undone, as it provides a sense of liberation to the wearer.\"\n\nIn this version, I've tried to maintain the original meaning of the phrase while using more eloquent and sophisticated language. I've also made some minor adjustments to the wording to improve the flow and readability of the translation. Let me know if you have any other requests!",
